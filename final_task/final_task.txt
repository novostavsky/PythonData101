There is an API server that returns the OLX apartment sale post info for the given day.
For example, here are the posts for the 19th of March 2017: https://35.204.204.210/2017-03-19/
Substitute the date in URL to get results for the other days.

You need to fetch the data for whole 2017 year from the API, day-by-day and store it into SQL database. Use a new local sqlite DB if you have no other options. If you have a dev database (e.g. Postgres or MS SQL Server) that you may utilize, use it instead.

Once you have all the data in the DB, run an SQL query to fetch statistics that is relevant to your personal assignment and create a graph/chart image.
